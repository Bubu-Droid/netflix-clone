# Netflix-Clone

A repository that contains code files and assets of a 'netflix clone project' I made.

This repository contains the code files that are purely made by using HTML and CSS by hand. This project was a part of the latest 'Sigma Web Dev' course by CodeWithHarry. I have tried imitating the netflix website including the responsiveness to the utmost of my capabilities.

TBH after realizing the amount of time I have spent away behind making this project, I kind of repent a bit since I made this project during a very crucial time period which I should have had rather spent doing studies and stuff, but whatever; no use remarking the time I have already spent. Took me about 6 days/a week worth of work to completely build this.
